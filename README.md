# visualizingAlgos
### Overview
Using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) with c++ to visualize algorithms. You will need to download the SFML libraries to be able to run this project, see the makefile for information on where to put the libraries as well as how to compile the code. I've also included a directory tree for reference.

This project currently works to visualize the following sorting algorithms:
* Bubble Sort 
* Insertion Sort

### Instructions
Press `R` to reset sorting.</br>
Press `B` to sort using the Bubble Sort algorithm.</br>
Press `I` to sort using the Bubble Sort algorithm.</br>
